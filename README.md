Developed a dynamic and responsive weather application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, incorporating key modern web development practices.
Current Location Weather: Utilized the 'navigator.geolocation' API to obtain the user's current location and display the real-time weather.
Search Functionality: Implemented a feature allowing users to search and display weather data for different locations.
API Integration: Integrated with a weather API (e.g.: OpenWeatherMap) to fetch and display current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, and weather descriptions.
Async/Await and Promises: Employed async/await and promise functions to handle asynchronous API calls, ensuring smooth and efficient data fetching.
Error Handling: Implemented error handling for API requests and geolocation access to enhance user experience and application reliability.
